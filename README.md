# Prince's Theatre

https://princes-theatre.surge.sh/

# Context

Prince's theatre is an app that incorporates a price comparison tool so the user can compare prices between two cinemas (Cinema World and Film World), and is visually displayed the cheapest option.
I decided to create the app with React as I wanted to gain more knowledge with it and my preferred language is Javascript.
For stylings I decided to use styled-components as I hadn't used it before for design.

# Challenges

There were quite a few hurdles along the way. Working with broken APIs was completely new to me.
I found the try statement to be helpful as it allows a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
Testing was the biggest hurdle. Having done limited unit tests with Javascript previously I spent most of my time on this project watching videos, reading documentation and purchased some courses on React testing to help.

# Future

In the future I think i would look into using setState() to set a loading state.
I would have liked to have more experience in testing before approaching this project but am thankfull for how much I've learned whilst creating this app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
